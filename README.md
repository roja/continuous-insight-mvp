## Overview

Continuous Insights is a sophisticated system developed by Rational Partners Advisory Ltd for conducting technology and product audits across organizations of various sizes and sectors. It provides a structured approach to assessing the maturity and effectiveness of a company's technology stack, processes, and product development approaches.

## Core Concepts

### The 5 Ps Framework

The audit system is built around five key areas of assessment:

- Product
- People
- Process
- Platform
- Protection

### Maturity Levels

Each area and sub-area is assessed using three maturity levels:

- Novice
- Intermediate
- Advanced

These levels are defined specifically for each criterion to provide nuanced evaluation.

### Evidence-Based Assessment

The audit process relies on evidence gathered from multiple sources:

- Interviews
- Documentation
- Code repositories
- System logs
- File uploads (supporting various formats)

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **FastAPI Backend**
   - RESTful API architecture
   - Async support for file processing
   - OAuth2 authentication
   - Role-based access control

2. **Database Layer**
   - SQLAlchemy ORM
   - SQLite database (configurable)
   - Data model for audit tracking

3. **AI Integration**
   - OpenAI API integration for analysis
   - Automated question generation
   - Evidence extraction and analysis
   - Image and document content analysis
